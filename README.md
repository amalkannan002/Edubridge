# Edubridge

EduBridge is a workforce development organization that has been setup with the vision of fulfilling the skill gap that exists currently between semi-urban/ economically backward youth and the skill requirements of the high-performing companies. EduBridge endeavors to be the Career Development companion for the youth of the country by impacting the entire Career Development Life Cycle of the Youth. This repository contains all the projects and assignments done by me during my Pg diploma Data Analytics course in EduBridge.
