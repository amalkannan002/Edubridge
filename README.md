# Edubridge

EduBridge is a workforce development organization that has been setup with the vision of fulfilling the skill gap that exists currently between semi-urban/ economically backward youth and the skill requirements of the high-performing companies. EduBridge endeavors to be the Career Development companion for the youth of the country by impacting the entire Career Development Life Cycle of the Youth.
